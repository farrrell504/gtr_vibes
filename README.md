## To Use:
On Mac, open Audio MIDI Setup (it's a program built into Mac OS)  
In Audio MIDI Setup, go to Window -> Show MIDI Studio  
In Audio MIDI Setup/MIDI Studio, go to MIDI Studio -> Open Bluetooth Configuration  
If the device has been flashed successfully, you should see it as a device with the `DEVICE_NAME` as defined in main.cpp, click Connect  
If connection is successful, the screen on the M5stick should now display "BLE Connected!"
